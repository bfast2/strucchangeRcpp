\title{Empirical Fluctuation Processes}
\description{Computes an empirical fluctuation process according
to a specified method from the generalized fluctuation test
framework, which includes CUSUM and MOSUM tests based on recursive
or OLS residuals, parameter estimates or ML scores (OLS first order
conditions).}
\usage{
\method{efp}{formula}(formula, data, type = , h = 0.15,
    dynamic = FALSE, rescale = TRUE, lrvar = FALSE, vcov = NULL, \dots)
\method{efp}{matrix}(X, y, type = , h = 0.15,
    dynamic = FALSE, rescale = TRUE, \dots)   
}

\arguments{
  \item{X, y, formula}{specification of the linear regression model:
    either by a regressor matrix \code{X} and a response variable \code{y},
    or by a \code{formula}.}
  \item{data}{an optional data frame containing the variables in the model. By
     default the variables are taken from the environment which \code{efp} is
     called from.}
  \item{type}{specifies which type of fluctuation process will be
     computed, the default is \code{"Rec-CUSUM"}. For details see below.}
  \item{h}{bandwidth (for MOSUM and ME processes
     only), either specified relative to the sample size as a numeric from interval (0,1),      or as an integer >= 1 determining the absolute bandwidth size (number of samples). }
  \item{dynamic}{logical. If \code{TRUE} the lagged observations are included as
     a regressor.}
  \item{rescale}{logical. If \code{TRUE} the estimates will be standardized by
    the regressor matrix of the corresponding subsample according to Kuan & Chen
    (1994); if \code{FALSE} the whole regressor matrix will be used.
    (only if \code{type} is either \code{"RE"} or \code{"ME"})}
  \item{lrvar}{logical or character. Should a long-run variance estimator
    be used for the residuals? By default, the standard OLS variance is employed.
    Alternatively, \code{\link[sandwich]{lrvar}} can be used. If \code{lrvar}
    is character (\code{"Andrews"} or \code{"Newey-West"}), then the corresponding
    \code{type} of long-run variance is used. (The argument is ignored for the
    score-based tests where \code{\link{gefp}} should be used instead.)}
  \item{vcov}{a function to extract the covariance matrix for the coefficients
    of the fitted model (only for \code{"RE"} and \code{"ME"}).}
  \item{\dots}{\emph{currently not used}.}
}

\details{If \code{type} is one of \code{"Rec-CUSUM"}, \code{"OLS-CUSUM"},
\code{"Rec-MOSUM"} or \code{"OLS-MOSUM"} the function \code{efp} will return a
one-dimensional empirical process of sums of residuals. Either it will be based
on recursive residuals or on OLS residuals and the process will contain
CUmulative SUMs or MOving SUMs of residuals in a certain data window.
For the MOSUM and ME processes all estimations are done for the
observations in a moving data window, whose size is determined by \code{h} and
which is shifted over the whole sample.

If \code{type} is either \code{"RE"} or \code{"ME"} a
\emph{k}-dimensional process will be returned, if \emph{k} is the number of
regressors in the model, as it is based on recursive OLS estimates of the
regression coefficients or moving OLS estimates respectively. The recursive
estimates test is also called fluctuation test, therefore setting \code{type}
to \code{"fluctuation"} was used to specify it in earlier versions of
strucchange. It still can be used now, but will be forced to \code{"RE"}.

If \code{type} is \code{"Score-CUSUM"} or \code{"Score-MOSUM"} a \emph{k+1}-dimensional
process will be returned, one for each score of the regression coefficients and one for
the scores of the variance. The process gives the decorrelated cumulative sums of the ML
scores (in a Gaussian model) or first order conditions respectively (in an OLS framework).

If there is a single structural change point \eqn{t^*}, the recursive CUSUM path
starts to depart from its mean 0 at \eqn{t^*}. The Brownian bridge type paths
will have their respective peaks around \eqn{t^*}.
The Brownian bridge increments type paths should have a strong change at \eqn{t^*}.

The function \code{\link{plot}}
has a method to plot the empirical fluctuation process; with
\code{sctest} the corresponding test on structural change can be
performed.

\value{
  \code{efp} returns a list of class \code{"efp"} with components including:
  \item{process}{the fitted empirical fluctuation process of class
    \code{"ts"} or \code{"mts"} respectively,}
  \item{type}{a string with the \code{type} of the process fitted,}
  \item{nreg}{the number of regressors,}
  \item{nobs}{the number of observations,}
  \item{par}{the bandwidth \code{h} used.}
