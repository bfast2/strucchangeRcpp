Description: A fast implementation with additional experimental features for
             testing, monitoring and dating structural changes in (linear)
             regression models. strucchangeRcpp features tests/methods from
	     the generalized fluctuation test framework as well as from
	     the F test (Chow test) framework. This includes methods to
	     fit, plot and test fluctuation processes (e.g., CUSUM, MOSUM,
	     recursive/moving estimates) and F statistics, respectively.
	     These methods are described in Zeileis et al. (2002)
	     <doi:10.18637/jss.v007.i02>.
             Finally, the breakpoints in regression models with structural
             changes can be estimated together with confidence intervals,
             and their magnitude as well as the model fit can be evaluated
             using a variety of statistical measures.
